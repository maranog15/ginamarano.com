# Lab assistant and teaching experience

I enjoy supporting teaching activities, especially when it comes to coding and simulations.
My mottos are:
- there is no perfect code, so relax!
- there is no reason to be afraid and asking for support!
- questions are never stupid (this one is borrowed :-))
- if you believe you know everything, then you are no scientist.


Up to today I had the honor to supervise the following thesis:
- Raphael Schmid (2023) - Bachelor Thesis in Forest Ecology at ETH Zurich. "Waldsukzession nach einem Waldbrand in den Schweizer Zentralalpen"

- Alessandro Aquino (2021) Master thesis in Forestry and Soil Science at the University of Naples Federico II (Italy). "Caratterizzazione dei suoli al limite del bosco: proprietà emergenti nelle treeline di Fagus sylvatica dell’Appennino Centro-Meridionale". Main supervisor: Prof. Fabio Terribile (Soil Science)


... and to support students with their thesis, namely:

- Livia Gysel (2024-ongoing) - Bachelor Thesis in Forest Ecology at ETH Zurich. "Veränderungen der Struktur und Dynamik von Naturwaldreservaten unter Klimawandeleffekten". Main supervisor: Prof. Harald Bugmann, co-supervisor: Dr. Ulrike Hiltner (ETH Zurich)
- Samuel Zweifel (2022) - Bachelor Thesis in Forest Ecology at ETH Zurich. "Analyses of tree regeneration after wind throw in a central Swiss forest: testing a forest succession model’s abilities. Main supervisor: Dr. Ulrike Hiltner (Forest Ecology, ETH Zurich), co-supervisor: Dr. Mathieu Levesque (Silviculture, ETH Zurich)

- Francesca Eccher (2023) MSc student at the Free University of Bolzano. Topic: Forest stand modelling on drought-prone forests in South Tyrol. Main supervisor: Dr. Marco Mina (EURAC)

- Laurin Hillebrand (2022-2023)  MSc student at the University of Innsbruck. Topic: Assessing the protective functions of South Tyrol forests under future climate change. Main supervisor: Dr. Marco Mina (EURAC)
