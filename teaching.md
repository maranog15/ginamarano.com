# Lab assistant and teaching experience

I enjoy supporting teaching activities, especially when it comes to coding and simulations.
My mottos are:
- there is no perfect code, so relax!
- there is no reason to be afraid and asking for support!
- questions are never stupid (this one is borrowed :-))
- if you believe you know everything, then you are no scientist.


Up to today I had the honor to supervise the following thesis:
- Raphael Schmid (2023) Bachelor Thesis in Forest Ecology at ETH Zurich "Waldsukzession nach einem Waldbrand in den Schweizer Zentralalpen"
- Alessandro Aquino (2021) Master thesis in Forestry and Soil Science at the University of Naples Federico II "Caratterizzazione dei suoli al limite del bosco: proprietà emergenti nelle treeline di Fagus sylvatica dell’Appennino Centro-Meridionale"

... and to support students with their thesis, namely:

- Samuel Zweifel (BSc, 2022): Analyses of tree regeneration after wind throw in a central Swiss forest: testing a forest succession model’s abilities
- Livia Gysel (BSc, 2024): Veränderungen der Struktur und Dynamik von Naturwaldreservaten unter Klimawandeleffekten 
- Laurin Hillebrand University of Innsbruck - MSc student (Topic: Assessing the protective functions of South Tyrol forests under future climate change)
- Francesca Eccher Free University of Bolzano - MSc student (Topic: Forest stand modelling on drought-prone forests in South Tyrol)
