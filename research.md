# Research

My research centers on developing and utilizing dynamic forest models to assess the impacts of droughts on temperate forests, with a particular emphasis on the stand scale. I am dedicated to dissecting and analyzing the processes that lead to signals, tipping points, and ultimately impacts on forest dynamics.

My scientific and practical reasoning is grounded in close-to-nature silvicultural principles and rooted in forest ecology. This drives my investigation into the impacts of silvicultural practices on forest resilience within the context of climate change scenarios. My objective is to determine the feasibility of adaptation through the development and application of dynamic forest models, meticulously designing management scenarios that closely replicate actual practices.

Additionally, I support and help in developing practice-oriented decision support tools to analyze both short-term and long-term forest dynamics. This includes the study of growth, regeneration, and mortality, as well as the effects of disturbances—primarily anthropogenic (such as management), biotic (such as pests), and abiotic (such as droughts)—on stand structure and forest productivity.
