# Research

My research centers on developing and utilizing dynamic forest models to assess the impacts of droughts on forest dynamics (growth, regeneration and mortality) in temperate forests, with a particular emphasis on the stand scale. I am dedicated to dissecting and analyzing the processes, signals and tipping points that ultimately lead to extreme impacts on forest structure and dynamics.

My scientific and practical reasoning is grounded in close-to-nature silvicultural principles and rooted in forest ecology. 
I am profoundly interested in designing silviculture scenarios and determine the feasibility of adaptation to future climatic conditions in forests ecosystems through dynamic forest models. 

Additionally, I can support and help in developing practice-oriented decision support tools to analyze both short-term and long-term forest dynamics. This includes the study of growth, regeneration, and mortality, as well as the effects of disturbances—primarily anthropogenic (such as management), biotic (such as pests), and abiotic (such as droughts)—on stand structure and forest productivity.
