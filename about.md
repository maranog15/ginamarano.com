I am a trained Forester and a Forest Scientist in training who discovered the existence of dynamic forest models, found them fascinating and decided to start crunching some programming languages.
I mainly focus on individual tree and stand scale dynamic forest models. So far (2019-2025), I worked on a process-based mechanistic model, the [3D-CMCC-FEM](https://www.forest-modelling-lab.com/the-3d-cmcc-model) and the process-oriented stand-scale forest gap model [ForClim](https://ites-fe.ethz.ch/openaccess/products/forclim).
Currently (s.2025), I am working on enhancing the climatic sensitivity of the individual empirically-based forest development model [MASSIMO](https://www.lfi.ch/en/about-the-nfi/modules/development-of-forest-and-wood-resources) developed to simulate the growth, mortality and regeneration of trees under user-defined management scenarios over the National Swiss Forest Inventory data.
My primary research interest lies in understanding the processes that lead to forest responses to extreme events, such as droughts, but also biotic disturbances (e.g. bark beetle and management activities).
Rather than adhering to a single modeling theory, I am interested in the diverse mechanisms that influence these outcomes. Models are in this sense powerful allies, but not a dogma, neither the absolute truth.
I believe that models offer a glimpse into potential future scenarios, helping us understand what forest ecosystems might experience under "what if" scenarios. As tools, they are indeed powerful, yet we as scientists and practitioners must be careful in using them and interpret their outcomes with caution.
Another area of interest for me is how silvicultural practices can shape forests to meet various objectives and enhance their functionality. 
Once my silviculture professor, Dr. Mario Pividori, gave a definition of silviculture that stayed with me ever since "Rather than the craft of chopping trees, Silviculture is the art of allowing the forest to properly grow". This is how I picture forest management each time I step into a forest stand, asking the fundamental questions: "who are you", "what were you", "where are you going"?
I particularly enjoy discussing problems and solutions with forest practitioners because they are the eyes and hands tasked with the great challenge to shape today's forest for the future to come. Despite such an ambitious (and often dangerous) job, foresters have often very limited tools to aid them when it comes to complex and conflicting decisions, especially climate change and future trajectories of forest dynamics.
It is in this context, I believe, that we as forest scientists can play a role in aiding and providing tools and insights on the potential future scenarios that the forest ecosystems might experience.

In August 2025 I obtained the PhD title in [Forest Ecology at ETH Zurich (FE)](https://fe.ethz.ch/en/) 
in the group of Stand and Landscape Dynamics under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Harald Bugmann 

I am a mother of a sweet boy and married to a Swiss forester.
In my leisure time (when I have some..!), I enjoy crafting wooden objects, painting, embarking in discussions about silviculture and making music.
