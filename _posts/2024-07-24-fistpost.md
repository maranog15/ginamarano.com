## Summary:

Blog and why 
It is indeed true that blogs are dead and we live on the surge of podcasts, tictocks and X's quick and fast consumption. Then why bother with long posts?
The idea is simply to put black on white the thoughts of somebody who bothers about too many things and wants to discuss them slowly. Just like my friend Martmotian uses to do (if you do not know him, please visit his blog) [here](https://marmotian.com/).


## What is this about

This is going to be a collection of thoughts, about:

- Silviculture today and in the future
- Forest practices
- Hi-story of forest ecology and silviculcure
- Working with wood
- Perspectives on Academia seen with the eyes of a person without the proper pedigree


I promise, posts will not be short nor boring :-)
