<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> Introduction</h1>
<div id="what-is-r" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> What is R</h2>
<p>R is a system for statistical computation and graphics. It consists of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger, access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs stored in script files.
To be able to use and understand R you will also need to know some basic concepts that all programming depends on. But do not be scared!</p>
<p><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#What-is-R_003f">Here</a> you can read a longer deffinition of what is R.</p>
<p><strong>R vs. Python</strong></p>
<p>I really like <a href="http://ucanalytics.com/blogs/r-vs-python-comparison-and-awsome-books-free-pdfs-to-learn-them/">this</a> comparison of python and R. The idea is that R is Batman and Python is Superman. Batman (R) does better detective work, has a more developed intelligence, or in other words Batmand is more brain than muscles. On the other hand Superman (Python) has muscle power and super strength, you could consider him more elegant, but in general words is more muscles than brain.</p>
<p>FUN FACT: The “Python” programming language name derived from the series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Flying_Circus">Monty Python’s Flying Circus</a>.</p>
<div id="why-r" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Why R</h3>
<p>There are several reason why R:</p>
<ul>
<li>it´s free</li>
<li>it´s well-documented and has an amazing user community</li>
<li>it runs almost everywhere</li>
<li>it has a large user base among researchers, data scientists, companies</li>
<li>it has a extensive library of packages helping to solve different tasks</li>
<li>it´s not a black box</li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to learn a tool is to use it for something useful, for example analyze data. Thats why this is the tool prefered in our courses. The goal it is not to master the tool or actually teach you R but to have the enough knowledge to be able to find your way to suceed in your goals and to have a basic knowledge that will aloow you to explore independtly and find the solutions that you need.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="what-is-rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> What is RStudio</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/">RStudio</a> is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.</p>
<div id="why-rstudio" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Why RStudio</h3>
<p>My friend usually sais that we have not come to this world to suffer, using Rstudio instead of just R makes your life easier, so it will avoid some unnecesary suffering. There is nothing wrong of just using R, without RStudio, and actually some people prefer to learn R without RStudio, not me. Some of the reasons why I prefer to use RStudio are:</p>
<ul>
<li>window docking (all necessary things in one window)</li>
<li>full-featured text editor</li>
<li>tab-completion of filenames, function names and arguments (you do not need to remember everything)</li>
<li>Rmarkdown and knitr integration</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="what-is-git" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> What is Git</h2>
<p><a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a> is a <strong>version control system</strong>. Probably the best ever description og Git is whaty XXX wrote: “it is as the “Track Changes” features from Microsoft Word on steroids”. It was created to help groups of developers to deal with big and complex projects. For a data science user, it is basically a clever way to ovoid having hundred “final version” files as described <a href="http://phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1531">here</a>.</p>
<p>It is both benefitial when working alone as you can delete that not-so-clever code that you wrote and never used, without been scared, as if future you need that piced of code you will be able to go back and take it. But Git benefits increase exponinetally when you include collaborators in the equation, use git it is a smart way to collaborate and to be up-to-date with each others work and at the same time have a version control of your and others people work. Some people think that hthe Git-pain is only worth it when collaborating, but even in that case, I am sure you are going to work with others in some point, and avoid taken that into consideration from the beginning will mean a delay in the implementation of it in your workflow and a higher pain than just Git-pain.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-github" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> What is GitHub</h2>
<p>A way of hosting your work online.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-it-is-in-for-me" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> What it is in for me?</h2>
<p>Maybe you are still wondering: what it is really in for me? I just wanted to do my statistical anaylisis and be done with it, do really all the gains possibly justify the inevitable pain of start using R, Rstudio, GitHub and Git?…</p>
<p>My personal experience is that doing things from the beginning with the correct aproach, although painful, may avoid a bigger pain in the future. As soon as you get into your best workflow easier for you would be to do things right and realised early about mistakes. Of course your workflow won’t be a static thing, you will continiouly learn new aproaches and techniques that will improve the way you do things. Saying that I also think that one thing is what it is the best workflow for each of us as individuals (if you like to write your essays on a paper and then in a word document, thats fine for me), but a different thing is what is the best way to collaborate and work with others. In the first case you chose, in the second case chosing should be always on what is the best for the team-work, meaning higher productivity, less chances of errors, easier collaboration etc. And yes, you are going to work with others most of the times. There is were Git and RStudio are going to make your life easier!</p>
